Problem statements go below here----------------------------------<br>
AI is too easily abused by students to give them answers. This reduces the effectiveness of homework for students. For example, many questions, even advanced questions can now be copy and pasted into an AI prompt and reward the students with a fairly accurate answer. Before, the hassle and effort required to search the internet for the answer typically prevented such easy answers leading to effort being required even when online searches were used. The other solution of banning the use of AI offers other unique problems such as students being falsely accused of AI use, and students simply using it when they can not get caught, all that while refusing the helpful qualities that AI could have on learning. How can we design a system where AI’s strong search abilities can be used to help students learn rather than being used as a way to avoid learning or being scorned.<br>

Students in the computer science fields often struggle with the transition to the professional world from academia. This creates tension and uncertainty when taking on projects as a new developer due to factors like imposter syndrome. This can lead to struggles both for the developer as well as the company due to an assumption that what is to be completed on the job should be already known. The junior developer can struggle to ask for help when they encounter something they don’t understand. Internships can be seen as a way to bridge this gap by offering “real world” experience, however the role of an intern can often be seen as not being a fully fledged developer, and this may sway these inexperienced developers even further from asking for help from their peers. How could we comfortably bridge the gap between the academic world of computer science into the fast paced professional setting.
